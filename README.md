Interactive fiction development using inform v6.
To be compiled with i6 and run on vintage (or emulated) micro-computers from the 80's.

On Linux, just use the MetroCenter84 installer. On MacOS you need to use the
Inform6 compiler and the headers from the metro84 library, example:
```
inform6 -v3 +/usr/local/share/retroinform/metro84 game.inf
```

## TODO
 - [ ] set up project scaffolding
 - [x] set up build scripts
 - [ ] write story :)
